# MyStore Project Overview

MyStore is Angular application that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process. 

## Getting Started

To use these files, simply merge the folders into the root directory of your scaffolded Angular application.


###Don't forget to use this in your Angular terminal:

npm install
ng serve -o
it should open the project and simulate the user experience well.
